# Flow charts

This Dataiku DSS plugin helps you create, without code, charts to visualize transfers, transitions or other types of flows.

It contains several webapps for different flavors of the Sankey chart.

The charts are based on the [Google Charts library](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and require internet access.
